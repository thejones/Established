# Established: A Hapi API

## Why? 
I wanted to learn more about Hapi. What we have here is a port of MEAN.JS server. 
It is a not a direct port as it does add/remove a few things. What a great way to learn...
This project should feel very familiar to Express developers.  

## What's inside 

* Hapi
* Hapi ecosystem (lab, good, boom, etc) 
* MongoDB + mongoose 
* JWT authentication 
 
 
## Coming soon 
 
 * More tests. Lab makes these so EASY!
 * Finish auth flow - Add email, forgot password, etc. WIP
 * Add Stripe into the mix. WIP 
 * Bug fixes and things I missed. 
 
 
## Credits 
* MEAN.JS project as this is a port of that code. 
* Frame - User API written in Hapi 
* Hapi-Boilerplate (Basic structure of this project) 
* Hapi website. Docs are rock solid on that site.
